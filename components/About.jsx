                <p className="BigFirstLetter  font-medium">I&apos;m an up and coming Software Developer from Denver, Colorado. I was exposed to programing in my sophomore year of high school and have been fascinated with it ever since. I took a couple of programming classes in college and decided that Computer Science was the right fit for me. So I decided to take my career even further by taking a course at General Assembly.  </p>
